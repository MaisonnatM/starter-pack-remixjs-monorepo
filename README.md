This monorepo was created with `pnpm` for space efficiency and more convienence
in monorepos than `npm`.

## Local development

All the following commands are run from the root of the monorepo.

### Install dependencies

```bash
pnpm i
```

Given the name of our app in `package.json` is `@epic-stack-monorepo/epic-app`:

### Build all packages

```bash
pnpm run --filter @epic-stack-monorepo/epic-app build
```

### Dev epic-stack app

```bash
pnpm run --filter @epic-stack-monorepo/epic-app dev
```
